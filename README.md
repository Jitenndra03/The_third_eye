#The paper describes an AI-based approach to monitor mobile phone usage during lectures or conferences. The proposed approach uses facial recognition and object detection techniques to detect gestures such as yawning, using a phone, bowing down head, etc., which signify that a student is not attentive in the class. The paper includes ubiquitous computing using facial and object detection algorithms to analyze studentsâ€™ behavior. Combining the above two approaches helps in achieving the stated problem in the classroom.
